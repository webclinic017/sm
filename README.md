Multidisciplinary system modeling in microservices 

Objectives:
- Describe dynamic systems as a direted graph from a variety of diffent types of component models.
- Data driven component models and system model creation and validation.
- Design exploration of design and model limits
- Desing synthesis optimizing scaler, tensor, and dynamic objectives

Design Synthesis
At this point, there is a lot of public interst in test synthesis with ChatGPT.  This is fundamentally a stack of linear systems where $\Delta x = Ax + Bu$ where the state matricies are trained to predict the next work in all of the text vacuumed up from the internet.  The training is extremely inefficient.  The results in language synthesis is impressive.  

What is would be beneficial for design synthesis?  Optimization has a concept of design space and objective space.  Models are created to explore design space find a design that maximizes objectives.  Optimization does not focus on learning an entier space.  Surogate modeling learns an entier space with a reduced order model.  Data driven design fits a model of a specific design based on data.

All of these seem much more limited to natural language process response sysnthesis.  Given a question, a path through the transformer model state space synthesizes a response.  For engineering design, we would want to understand a specific design or create a specific design.
